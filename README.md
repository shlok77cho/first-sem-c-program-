## 📁 Repository Structure

> ⚠️ **Note:** All programs are currently stored as **separate `.c` files** (not inside folders).
> The **file names clearly indicate the topic** they belong to.

### 🔖 File Naming Convention

Each file follows a simple and readable naming style:

* `array_*.c`
* `function_*.c`
* `loop_*.c`
* `operator_*.c`
* `pointer_*.c`
* `recursion_*.c`
* `string_*.c`
* `structure_*.c`
* `union_*.c`
* `user_function_*.c`

**Example:**

* `array_linear_search.c`
* `loop_factorial.c`
* `pointer_swap.c`
* `string_length.c`
